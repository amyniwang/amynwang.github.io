<h2> About Me </h2>


<p class = "quote"> <p>   Toronto is where I live but <b>my home is international</b>.
I was born in northeast China & 
                            immigrated to Canada when I was a kid. We touched down in Calgary, Alberta and lived there for a while 
			before settling in Fort McMurray, home of Canada's energy sector. I was 17 when I jetted off to <a href="https://www.mcmaster.ca/" target=_blank" >university </a>.</p>

<p> My four years as an undergrad has been an absolute adventure. I played music, volunteered with the elderly, travelled around the globe (first to Australia, then through Europe, and finally to the Dominican Republic to teach about self-determination). I wrote a thesis about how the socio-economic outcomes of participating in government programs and presented my findings. </p>
<p> I graduated in 2015 and moved to London, Ontario to start my Masters. I began looking more into policy influence on curriculum and educational outcomes. I was awarded a grant to go to Norway at the Academy of Music to research culture influences on Norwegian workers compared to Canada. 
It was during this time that I knew wanted to be more involved in policy work; or become a <i> policy wonk </i> so to speak. And thus began my shift into public policy...</p>

<p> I graduated in 2016 with a Masters in Music Education and began my summer internship at Fort McMurray's regional library as a Outreach Assistant. My role was to deliver reading programs to patrons that lived in remote indigenous communities that otherwise would not have access to these resources. 
On May 3, 2016 a natural disaster struck the town and we were forced to evacuate. During those difficult times, I was able to explore Alberta's rocky mountains for a breath of fresh air and attend University of Sherbrooke's Explore Program to learn French and immerse myself in Quebec culture. I continued to study French after that. I am constantly amazed by all that our country has to offer and the vast geography is simply breathtaking. <i> Oui!</i>

<p> in 2018, I graduated from a Masters in Public Service from the University of Waterloo. This was a program designed to fulfill the need for specialized applied public sector training and it allowed me to embark on developing new skills in project management, communications, collaboration, economics, and sociology. Once all the course work was complete, I became an intern at Metrolinx's Internal Audit department. 
 An internship is a rite of passage in to working in the public sector professionalism. I worked with a highly skilled set of audit professionals to transform policy used for financial controls and risk management within our organization. I developed a knowledge management program that documented scripts, processes, data sources and outcomes; including manuals with procedures, and repositories to house knowledge on internal servers and further delivered these materials to its end users. 
Based on these achievements, I was promoted to an Analyst position in IT to analyze financial data through dashboards - ensuring optimal data extraction for requisite reporting.

</P>
<p> These experiences allowed me to gain insight into the detail oriented, multi-faceted issues related to policy development. A few months ago I moved into Metrolinx's Realty department as a Realty & Legal Liaison. I help identify property development issues that could impact the overall performance of capital projects, including policy recommendations to ensure best practices on meeting project initiatives. 

Having worked in various departments, I am extremely thankful to have developed a thorough understanding of the inner workings of a public organization from different perspectives. It's been an interesting journey to get to here but I'm excited to see where all of this will take me in the future. </p>

<h2>Getting Your PMP Certification on the First Try</h2>

<p class = "quote"> <i> FYI I published this article on Medium on May 17, 2019. Click <a href = "https://medium.com/@amynwang/getting-your-pmp-certification-on-the-first-try-1357632e92b9" >here</a> for the original post.</i> </p>


<p>I am a young professional working in the public sector who just got their project management certification. In the last year, I started a high risk/high reward journey of self-study; bootstrapping my way to a PMP certification. Getting this certification was not necessary; but a personal goal that I made myself see through to the end. I realized that I wanted something to give me an edge and provide value to my organization by speaking the project management language and using industry proven methodical techniques/best practices. I was determined to prove to myself that I could build a tangible skillset that I believed would benefit my career.</p>

<p> I first became aware of the certification in my graduate program. I completed a course called Project Management in the Public Sector and I was lucky that it qualified for the 35 contact hours I needed to write the PMP exam. I got my contact hours long before I ever thought about getting the PMP; it was a mandatory component of my program at school. Had I known, I would have definitely paid more attention in class... </p>
<p> Right at the start of my career I became immersed in project management. I sat in war rooms with senior team members coming up with tactical solutions to problems of the day and strategizing together to deliver a product. Many of the project managers and senior leads advised that I should get my PMP certification to level up on my business acumen, strategy, and organizational skills. As I began to solicit advice from experienced project managers and yet-to-be PMPs they emphasized about how grueling the exam was and how it took many of them multiple tries to pass. The exam is notoriously famous for its fail rate. These stories made me terrified of the exam, but it also forced me take my studying much more seriously and kept me humble throughout the process. I knew that if I was serious about getting my PMP then I would need to be disciplined with my time and commit my efforts to a plan. </p>
<p>I sat for my exam a month ago and with some reflection, I am closing this "project" by sharing my lessons learned:</p>


<p><b>Initiate: Do your research and get acquainted with the materials </b> </p>
<p> Once you have committed to the goal of pursuing your PMP, it is time to fill out an application with the PMI. I used Excel to keep track of all my project experiences and completed the requirements on a spreadsheet prior to actually inputting the information in the application. When composing the project descriptions for each project, use PMI terms that demonstrate your knowledge of project management. There are many templates on the internet that you can use to organize your experiences into the categories required of the application. Any one of them should do the trick. </p>
<p> For those of you nervous about whether or not their personal experience would help or hinder their exam, I don't think it matters much as long as you study right. Your studying should begin with getting the <a href = "https://www.pmi.org/pmbok-guide-standards" >Project Management Body of Knowledge </a> (aka PMBOK); as this is what the exam is actually based on. Start with a quick skim through of the text just to see what you would be working with and that will give you a benchmark of your current knowledge.</p>


<p>
Unfortunately, the PMBOK is an in-depth, heavy textbook that can not be easily digested without prior knowledge. Therefore, I would recommend acquiring a study guide that would take a step-by-step approach to simplify the PMBOK. There are a lot of good resources out there and honestly, you can't really go wrong with whatever source you choose, as long as it is up to date to the current version (right now it's the 6th edition).
</p>
<p>Personally, I used two study guides: <a href = "https://store.rmcproject.com/pmp-exam-prep-ninth-edition" >Rita Mulcahy's "PMP Exam Prep 9th Edition"</a> and <a href ="https://www.amazon.com/PMP-Project-Management-Professional-Study-ebook/dp/B079MNT9QJ" >Kim Heldman's "PMP: Project Management Professional Exam Study Guide 9th Edition" </a></p> 

<p> I purchased Rita's book based on reviews and recommendations from colleagues and I am so glad that I did. Her end of chapter questions are famous for testing whether you really know your stuff. I was originally only going to stick to Rita's study guide but I found Kim's study guide in my local library and thought I'd give it a try (I'd recommend checking out what resources are available in your public library - especially if they are free!). Kim's book lays out the content based on process groups, which is more applicable for the exam, while Rita's is on the knowledge areas. </p>
<p> Both of the study guides I used supplemented my learning in their own ways, however if you are on a budget and time crunch then I would recommend to stick to one source. While there are many options out there on the market, the exam will only focus on material that reflects the PMBOK standards so there is no need to waste your time on generalized fluff that does not teach to the exam.</p>


<p><b>Plan: Make a realistic schedule and stick to it </b></p>
<p> Once you submit your application, and get it approved, you are eligible for 1 year to take the exam. I took the exam on the last day before my eligibility ends. Please <b> <i> do not </b></i> do this. Submit your application and book your test AFTER you are ready. I was going to give myself a lot more buffer time but some stuff happened in my life and I had to keep pushing it back until the last moment. Whoops.</p>

<p> One of the strategies I used to keep myself accountable was telling everyone I knew about my goal. By telling others, I am in a sense, making it real. Whenever someone asked "how's the studying going?" and "when's your test again?" I got a renewed sense of determination to pass. My family was asking me, my friends were asking me, my colleagues were asking me. I mean...the fear of failure is not that bad when only yourself know, but to have everyone else know too?! The stakes can feel much higher! Especially when it's your employer asking you those questions...</p>
<p>During the last couple months of my studying I had to "crash" my resources to make up for lost time. I was spending 2-3 hours a day and all day on the weekends. I would study whenever possible; lunch breaks, on my subway commute, and the library straight after work. Planning time for studying is a priority. Figure out a schedule that works for you, whether it's condensed in short months or spread out over a longer term, and <i> stick to it </i>.</p>
 

<p> <b>Execute: Study, study, study (to understand, not memorize)</b> </p> 
<p> I began my studying journey with reading the PMBOK guide. Some people have said that they were able to pass the exam without opening the book but I believe that reading PMBOK was essential to my success. The exam itself is based on the PMBOK and there is merit to reading straight from the source. After skimming through PMBOK the first time, I went through it a couple more times while referencing the study guides (mentioned above) to ensure that I understood the details of all the concepts.</p>
<p> To supplement my readings, I would often turn to YouTube videos such as <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC7pN8Mjot8" >Ricardo Vargas</a> and <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/user/Praizion" >Praizion</a> for concepts explained in common-day language. Ricardo has a diagram follow that demonstrates processes, inputs and outputs. I wrote them down over and over until I could remember all of them. In addition, during my commutes to work I would open the <a href =" https://www.pocketprep.com/exams/pmi-pmp/">PocketPrep</a> app and do a few multiple choice questions. The question bank was very basic but it was good to have when you're on the go.</p>

<p> After some time I was starting to feel lost in all the information and felt like I needed guidance to focus on the info that I should grasp, so I signed up for an online exam prep course. It was mostly an exam bank that was very expensive but I was able to chat to other students and ask questions to an instructor. It was during this course that I first realized the importance of finding a good practice exam bank.</p>
<p> Practice exams are essential to get familiar with the format of the exam. There are lots of online free practice exams that you should take to gauge your preparedness. I took the <a href = "https://www.oliverlehmann.com/contents/free-downloads/175_PMP_Sample_Questions.pdf" >free Oliver Lehmann 200 questions practice exam</a>  twice during my studies; once when I began studying and the second time just a few days before my exam. The <a href = "https://www.project-management-prepcast.com/pmp-exam/the-pmp-exam-simulator" >PM Prepcast Simulator</a> is also an excellent resource. I would not have passed without this as they simulate the actual exam with questions that are fairly on par for difficulty (I would say their questions can even be harder than the actual exam). Not only is the PMP a test of your knowledge but also sitting through 4 hour exam can be grueling so it is crucial to simulate the actual experience prior to the big day. There are 8 simulated exams on PM Prepcast and I did one simulation per week leading up to my exam. They say that you are ready for the real thing once you are comfortably scoring around 80% on the practice exams. By the time my exam day arrived, I felt like I was just doing another simulation. Managing your exam expectations is key.</p>
<p> <b> Monitor & Control: Practice makes perfect </b> </p> 

<p>Go over your practice exam results. Once I completed a practice test I would review the questions that I got wrong. But also just as important, I would make sure to look over the questions that I got right. Sometimes I would correctly guess a question right but I know that it wouldn't help me in the real exam. The practice exams are here to show your weaknesses so they can become your strengths. Do not get discouraged if you get lower than expected grade. The only way to learn is through trial and error. Many questions on the exam do not have the right answer, but it is your job to choose the best answer, which can only be learned through practice. I was doing questions so much that I started memorizing the answers but I don't think it hurt me that much in the end. As long as you understand the reason behind the question and answer, then the more practice the better.</p>
<p> <b> Close: Exam Time </b> </p> 
<p> In the few days leading up to the exam I was nervous as heck, to make myself feel more at ease knowing I'm not alone in this journey I poured through this subreddit page for last minute advice and other people's success stories to keep me motivated.</p>
<p> I went to the testing center the day before my exam to check out my route and location and I'm so thankful I did. I had a delay in my commute on my way to the exam and knowing the exact location helped calm my nerves. Always leave enough buffer time!</p>
<p> My strategy during the exam was to review the first 20 questions since I knew in the beginning my mind would be out of sorts from nerves. I finished all the questions at 2:45hours and literally read over all the 200 questions again and changed a few answers. Read the questions carefully because in my experience, a lot of the exam is trying to distract you with unnecessary information. I also made sure that I know which process group the question is in; for example, if it's asking for a plan then it can't be in the initiating phase. Honestly, I found the answers to be so vague that I didn't know if I had passed or failed the whole time. My body was shaking when pressed the submit button and almost collapsed when I saw the "Congratulations" screen appeared. The biggest relief!</p>
<p> <b>Final Thoughts </b> </p> 
<p> To be honest, I believe that anyone can pass the PMP exam...if they studied right. If you'd like to ensure that you made a sound investment of your resources (i.e. time and money), I recommend that you treat this endeavour like a project in the workplace and be disciplined. My PMP journey was grueling to say the least; no social life in the evenings and barely any on the weekends. But in the end, it is only a short term pain for a long term gain. I became much more knowledgeable in my field and confident of my skills in my future endeavours.</p>

<h2>Side Projects</h2>

<p class = "quote"> I'm obsessed with learning new things. This year alone, I got a certificate in project management, taught myself to use the sewing machine, and now I am building my own website. All of this has got me thinking about side projects and what it means to have one.</p>

<p> A side project is really just a project that you do outside of your regular job...and may also bring you income. Generally, you have a full time job and would have spare time on the weekends and evenings. Many people would believe that a side hustle is working at another job such as a cashier or bartender, but that isn't really what a side project is. A side project is YOU running your OWN thing ... on the side. What that may look like is a product that you designed/made yourself or you can have a service that someone will pay you for. </p>
<p> Here are some examples: </p>
<div>

<p><li> <b>Digital product </b> - Podcaster and e-book. Make an e-book about your experiences that have gotten you out of trouble. </li>
<li> <b>Services</b> - Photography or online fitness trainer </li>
<li> <b>Physical product</b> - a craft that is handmade, organic, or vegan.</li>
</p>

<p>
<i>How to start brain storming ideas?</i>
</p>
Look at your current skills. How long will it take you to get those skills? But once you know what your skills are then look at which ones you are best at AND what is your passionate about? For example, if you find yourself writing a paper at the last minute because you hate it then looking into writing articles as a side project might not be the best idea. Ahem..me. </p> 


<p>
Then with your ideas in mind, you can narrow down your ideas to your top three. 
At the end of the day you want to pursue something you can not stop talking about; which can become pretty obvious. </p>

<p>
All that is great... but what if you <i> fail? </i>  </p>
<p> I try to tell myself that Failure only happens when I quit. I don't quite believe in the idea of failure, you learn a lot of valuable things and come out stronger. And that does not mean don't quit that idea, but pick another idea and keep going. </p>

<p> <b> Happy Side Hustling! </b> </p>
